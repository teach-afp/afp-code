{-
   Observe that, by the left identity law,

   return x >>= k == k x

   We know that

   return x >>= k == return x (by definition of >>=)

   So, the monadic law says

   return x == k x

   However, it is easy to come up with a function k which falsifies
   the equation. For example,

   k = \_ -> exPhanton

   Observe that ex1P was created with applicative functors!
