# Lecture 2: (Embedded) Domain Specific Languages

[Lecture slides](https://rawgit.com/patrikja/AFPcourse/master/L2/slides.html)

Below is just a "table of contents" for the lecture.

## Learning outcomes for L2

This lecture we will focus on the following subset of the full [AFP
course learning outcomes](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/index.html#goal):

* DSL: design embedded domain specific languages
    * DSL.Concepts: (abstract) syntax, semantics, ...
    * DSL.Implement: implement EDSLs in Haskell (as combinator libraries)
* Types: read, understand and extend Haskell programs which use advanced type system features
    * Types.Class: type classes, newtypes, deriving, ...
* Expl: explain and discuss the above topics

## Anatomy of an EDSL
## Primitive and derived operations
## Think about: Compositionality, Abstraction
## Implementation of an EDSL
## Shallow embedding of Signals
## Deep embedding of Signals
## Deep versus Shallow
## Case Study: A language for Shapes, v1
## A language for Shapes, v2
## More on the interfaces
## Side track: A matrix library
## Shallow embedding
## Shallow embedding, continued
## Deep embedding
## Deep embedding, without GADT for reference
## Deep embedding, cont.
## Abstraction!
## More interesting run function: render as ASCII-art
## Connect back to to Signals
## Discussion
## Summary

* Different kinds of operations
    *  constructor functions, combinators, run functions
* Implementation styles
    * Shallow: representation given by the semantics
    * Deep: representation given by the syntax 
* Remember
    * Compositionality
    * Abstraction
